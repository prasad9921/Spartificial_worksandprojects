A descriptive comment explaining the change, e.g., if you are adding an extra conv2d layer, write about all the aspects of the conv2d layer you are adding. The comment should be placed at the point where the layer will be added. \n","\n","2. Changes brought to the system because of changes you introduced, e.g., if you changed layers - added, deleted, etc., you MUST show model properties before and after the changes were made.\n","\n","3. Data preprocessing changes - if you use new data preprocessing techniques that are not a part of this notebook, you MUST explain their inner workings using 2-3 MARKDOWN cells, and ONLY AFTER THAT,  proceed to use that technique. Without this explanation, your technique will not be considered for evaluation.\n","\n","4. ALL improvements MUST BE REPORTED VIA PLOTS OR TABLES OR BOTH, e.g., if increasing epochs from 30 to 50 improved your results, but decreasing learning_rate from 0.0001 to 0.00005 also improved your results, then these gains FIRST HAVE TO BE REPORTED SEPARATELY VIA PLOTS, THEN AGAIN TOGETHER VIA TABLES. \n","\n","  One plot can show iou values increasing from epoch 30 to epoch 50. Another plot can show iou values improving at varying learning rates. Finally tables can be used to show iou values for different learning rates, table 1 for lr_1 shows iou for epochs 30 through 50, table 2 for lr_2 shows iou for epochs 30 through 50, and so on and so forth - ALL YOUR RESULTS MUST BE COMPULSORILY QUANTIFIABLE! \n","\n","It is therefore advised to work on one improvement, optimize it, plot it, document it, then proceed to the next improvement - till you get a satisfactory IOU score.\n","\n","5.
